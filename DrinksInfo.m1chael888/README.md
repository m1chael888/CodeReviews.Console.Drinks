# DrinksInfo.m1chael888
This is a simple program used to call a drinks menu API in a C# Console. API calls are done using RestSharp, and the results are displayed in the console using Spectre.

# How it works
* Starting the app will display a main menu, allowing you to view drink categories or exit the app. Choosing to view categories will display a list of all available drink categories. To choose a category, navigate up and down the list using your arrow keys and press enter to select one. 
* After choosing a category, a list of all matching drinks will be similarly displayed, and you can choose one in the same way. After choosing a drink, the details associated with it will be displayed, including the drinks name, id and thumbnail image url. You can then press any key to return to the menu.
